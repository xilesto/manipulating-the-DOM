        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Before reading about the various chart patterns in this book, it is wise to review
the performance of the stock market during the period. Figure 1 shows a
monthly price chart of the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index. Beginning in
mid-1991, you can see that the market moved up at a leisurely pace, pausing
during much of 1994, and then resuming the climb at a steeper angle in 1995.
The index stumbled in August 1998 and made lower lows for 2 more months
before continuing upward, peaking in March 2000, and signaling an end to the
bull market. The move capped a rise of 418% from the start of the period.
After that, the downhill bear run began, reaching a low in October 2002, for a
decline measuring 51%. The index bounced once but made a higher low in
March 2003, signaling a trend change. Thus, the October low marked the end
of the bear market.
What does all this mean? The bear market measures from March 24,
2000, to October 10, 2002—about 2.5 years long. For data collection purposes,
the bull market is everything else, about 11 years long. That covers the
period I used to search for chart patterns in this edition.</p>

        <h2>Investing using chart formation</h2>
        <p>I could give a dentist’s drill to any person walking by, but that doesn’t mean I
would let that person near my teeth. This book is just like that. It gives you the
tools to invest successfully. It suggests which chart patterns work best and which
ones to avoid. Whether you can make money using them is entirely up to you.
I call this book an encyclopedia because that is how I use it. Whenever I
see a chart pattern forming in a stock I own, or am thinking of buying, I read
the applicable chapter. The information refreshes my memory about identification
quirks, performance, and any tips on how I can get in sooner or more
profitably. Then I search for similar patterns in the same stock (using different
time scales), and if that does not work, I search for similar patterns in stocks in
the same industry. I look at them closely to determine if their secrets are
applicable to the current situation. I try to learn from their mistakes.</p>

        <h2>Chart patterns</h2>
        <p>Shape. The shape of the formation is distinct. It reminds me of chaos
theory where small disturbances oscillate back and forth, then grow unbounded,
wreaking havoc. In the stock market, price reaches a new high then
crosses over and makes a new low, creating the broadening pattern. When you
draw a trend line across the minor highs and another connecting the minor
lows, the formation looks like a megaphone.
Trend lines. The two trend lines drawn across the minor highs and lows
are important. The top trend line should slope up; the bottom one should
slope down. The diverging trend lines distinguish the broadening bottom from
other types of formations, such as the right-angled broadening formation
(which has one horizontal trend line) or the broadening wedge (both trend
lines slope in the same direction). So it is important that each trend line has a
slope that is opposite the other.
Touches. A broadening bottom needs at least two minor highs and two
minor lows to be a valid formation. Anything fewer means you are incorrectly
identifying the formation. What is a minor high or low? A minor high is when
prices trend up, then drop back down, leaving a clearly defined peak. A minor
low is just the same thing flipped upside down: Prices move lower, then head
back up leaving a clearly defined valley. Figure 1.1 shows five minor highs or
lows, labeled by numbers. The odd numbers tag the minor highs and the even
numbers are the minor lows. Let me stress that the minor highs and lows need
not be alternating, as in Figure 1.1. Just as long as you can count at least two
peaks and two valleys—wherever they may appear—that is fine.
Volume. There is nothing magical in the volume trend. I performed linear
regression from the start of each formation to the end point (not the breakout
point that is usually a month beyond the end of the formation) and found
that volume rises about 57% of the time. If you look closely at broadening bottoms, you will find that volume sometimes
follows price. In Figure 1.1, the price decline between peak 1 and trough
2 shows a receding volume trend. When prices head up from point 2 to point 3,
so does volume. If you were to place a thin wooden plank between the volume
peaks in late November and late January, it would bow downward in a U shape.
A U-shaped volume pattern occurs slightly more often than other shapes.
Breakout. The breakout point is difficult to identify in a broadening formation
as it develops. I look for the place where price pierces the up or down
trend line or makes an extended move. If price pierces the trend line, then the
penetration point becomes the breakout point. If prices move up and follow
along the top trend line without piercing it, then I backtrack to the prior minor
high and draw a horizontal line forward in time until prices cross it. When that
happens, that is the breakout point.
Let me give you an example. Consider the broadening bottom shown in
Figure 1.2. The price trend over the preceding month leading to the formation
is downward. The two trend lines outline a widening price pattern as you
would expect from a broadening formation. There are more than two minor
highs and two minor lows pictured, meeting another criterion mentioned
in Table 1.1.
Where is the breakout? This formation is particularly easy. If you extend
the top trend line upward, you find that prices rise well above the line, signaling
an upward breakout. Then it is just a matter of backtracking to the highest
minor high and drawing a horizontal line to determine the actual breakout
price. Point A marks the highest high in the formation.</p>

        <h2>Trading Tactics</h2>
        <p>Go long at the low. Once you have uncovered a broadening bottom,
with two minor highs and two minor lows, you can think about trading it.
When the price bounces off the lower trend line, buy the stock. Sell when
prices turn down. The downturn may occur as a partial rise partway across the
formation, or prices may cross completely to the other side, touch the top
trend line, and head down. Remember, the formation may stage an upward
breakout, so do not sell too soon and cut your profits short.
Long stop. In a rising price trend, place a stop-loss order 0.15 below the
minor low. Should the stock reverse and head down, you will be taken out with
a small loss. As the stock rises to the opposite side of the formation, move your
stop upward to 0.15 below the prior minor low. The minor low may act as a
resistance point, so you will be giving the stock every opportunity to bounce off
the resistance level before being cashed out.
Go short at the high. The trading tactic for downward breakouts is the
same. When prices touch the top trend line and begin moving down, short
the stock.
Short stop. Place a stop-loss order 0.15 above the highest high in the formation,
then pray that prices decline.
Move stop. If luck is on your side and the stock heads down, move your
stop lower. Use the prior minor high—place the stop 0.15 above it.
Other. If the stock makes a partial rise or decline, consider acting on it.
This is a reliable breakout signal. Take advantage of it but make sure you place
a stop-loss order in case the trade goes bad.
Once prices break out and leave the broadening pattern, consider selling
if the price nears the target. There is no guarantee that the price will hit or
exceed the target, so be ready to complete the trade, especially if there is a
resistance level between the current price and the target. The stock may reach
the resistance point and turn around.</p>
